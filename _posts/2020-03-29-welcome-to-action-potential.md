We all have that one goal that drives us. Starting a business. Landing the dream job. Writing a book. Painting a masterpiece. The motivation is different for each of us, but the thing that is constant regardless of the goal is the amount of hard work and focus needed to get there.

Yet even such all-consuming targets are growing increasingly difficult to achieve. We finally sit down to focus, and then it starts.

Bzz. Ding. A cacophony of notifications and stimuli, ambushing you from every direction. Before you realize it, you've been sucked down a mineshaft of pointless trivia. More importantly, you have made no progress on your big dream. [A dream deferred](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46548/harlem). We are letting our dreams go by the wayside in exchange for some cheap party favors. 

In a time of constant connectivity, how do we empower ourselves to work on these large, time intensive goals? Let's take a step back, and zoom in to the very thing that drives these desires - the brain.

By any count, the human brain is the pinnacle of technology. Every thought, every desire, every memory you have ever had comes from that three pound lump of tissue in your head. The incredible thing about the brain is its fundamental simplicity. Each part of the brain, whether controlling your motor functions, your emotions, or storing your memories are all built with the same basic cells.

These brain cells - neurons - meet at junctions called synapses. The way these connections are built forms the basis of how our thoughts are stored, how we process sensory information, and every other high level brain function. Neurons are the building blocks of the brain.

Signals are transmitted through neurons by an action potential. When a neuron is triggered, channels along it open causing a fast inrush of sodium ions. This causes a signal to travel from one end of a neuron to another, where it communicates through other neurons through those synapses.

So why are we talking about brain cells? Well, although these cells are inside our brains, they don't 'think' - they just 'do'. When a neuron is firing, it just fires. It doesn't stop to scroll through its Instagram feed and laugh at some memes. Our brains work so effectively precisely because they are so simple - they just do.

Similarly, we can't make progress on our big goals when we're surrounded by nagging distractions around us. How do we unlock our own action potentials and bring ourselves into our own flow state where we can execute on our big visions?

We could cut out the distraction altogether. Throw the phone away, lock ourselves in a room, buckle down and get to work. 

But what if somebody is trying to reach us with an important message? And what if the technology is precisely the enabler allowing us to accomplish our goals? How can I do research for my book, or build and maintain the connections for my business' success without taking advantage of the best tools the twenty-first century has to offer?

The solution is not to throw it all away. What's needed is a structure which provides us the tools to achieve our goals while also keeping the distractions at bay. But this structure should be flexible enough to still allow for fun, personal connections, and the freedom to let our minds wander. After all, we are humans - not brain cells. 

Through the Action Potential blog, we'll explore themes  around setting goals, achieving them, staying organized and managing distraction. Through my own failures, experimentation, and constant adjustment, I've built a fundamentally simple organizational framework that the Synapse operating system is built around. But this framework is not static - much like the networks of synapses in our brains, it is constantly evolving. Through my stories and exploration, I hope to give insight into the core ideas that drive this system.

At the end of the day, this is not about me. Synapse is for the creators, the artists, the thinkers, the doers. **Synapse is for you.**
